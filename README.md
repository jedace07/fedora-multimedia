# Fedora Multimedia

Simple script for automating the installation of proprietary repos, codecs and drivers. 

## Description

This script will:
- Enable RPMFusion
- Enable proprietary codecs
- Install Nvidia drivers
- Install corresponding hardware codecs
NOTE: I haven't tested this on any Silverblue or RHEL system, so I can't guarantee that it'll work on those, feel free to raise an issue or commit a patch if you happen to fix it.

### Installing and Running
